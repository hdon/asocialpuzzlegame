=================

This is just an experiment. Some kinda puzzle game with a social element.

You can start a new game, click on the game "board" to play, with a goal of making the board monochromatic.

You can watch other players' games live using the upper-left drop-down.

You can fork someone else's game and continue it from that point.

You can share your game with someone else so that you can cooperate.

Running
=======

To setup, edit config.js. Then: `npm install`.

To run: `node bundle && node server`.
